       <p>Hi, I'm Jay. I was born in Bangalore on Nov 5, 2008. I currently live in Dublin, California, but I lived there until my 11th birthday and then I moved here during COVID. I originally lived in an Airbnb in downtown Livermore, but we then found a house to rent in Dublin. I lived in that rented house for 2 years and then bought a house near Fallon Sports Park, where I currently live. My current goals are to Hit sub 30 seconds in 50 free, beat everyone else on my team in swimming, start coding competitive projects, and enter hackathons. I plan to achieve these things by going to the gym regularly, trying to code every day, and learning more about hackathons through research. I am being forced to make this career choice, but I like doing it.</p>

      <h2> About me </h2>
      <div>
       <p></p>
       <p> On one fateful day, while thinking of what to do for Halloween, I came up with the idea of doing a fundraiser for a cause. We first started by talking to that cause, and figuring out how to make the money and what the money is going to do. I then spent over 20 hours planning for it, which included buying resources, getting sponsors, getting people to donate, and more. It was a huge success. I had a lot of fun making this project. After doing this fundraiser, I realized just how much work needed to be put into making something like this, from getting sponsors from shops to getting people to come to the event. It was a lot of work but I enjoyed every second of it. The next time I do an event like this, I know what to do and what not to do. It is truly a learning experience for me and my leadership skills. My verbal, written, and physical communication skills increased as well.

          Intelligent,
          Intuitive,
          Knowledgeable,
          Loyal,
          Methodical, 
          Natural Leader,
          Open-Minded,
          Organized,
          Outgoing,
          Patient. These are just one of the few that describe me. In high school being a freshman, the options that i have are very limited so one of the few things i did was join clubs. Joining clubs was a difficult task, because i didnt know anyone who was there, but being surrounded by people who have the same intrests as me made it very easy to befriend them. It was a scary experience at first but I relaized how easy it was to just go up to someone similar to you and become freinds almost immedeatly.
